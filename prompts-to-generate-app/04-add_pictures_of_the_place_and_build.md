The last proposal, documented in the file "03-website-proposal-v3.md" of folder "claude-output" is approved.

The only addition is that you have to search yourself for some evocative and beatiful pictures of the place surrounding Bigolino.

After you have found the right images of the place, and defined how to use them in the site, generate a CLUADE.md file, if you think can help for future enhancements, and then build the website.
