# Decisions taken
1. The ironic comments besides the accommodation options are fine but should not mention any of the 4 guys
2. Let's go with GitHub pages
3. Add script based tests that are launched as a precommit step
4. Images are added to the list by a build script that is invoked as a precommit step

# Further question
Would it be possible to isolate the texts in files with clear names, so that if one of the guys wants to change something is has to change only the content of the relevan files?


# Your task
Your task is to review the proposal you have made and document the new proposal in a markdown document, different from the first one you created.
