## The Engineer Who Talks to Machines

Engineer, educated between the University of Padua and UCLA. He worked at Thoughtworks and is now at Capgemini in Milan, but his true love is artificial intelligence. He writes technical articles on Medium, freeCodeCamp, and InfoQ as if they were love letters to Large Language Models.

His GitHub profile (EnricoPicci) is full of repositories with names that sound like spells: *lambda-calculus-typescript*, *mobile-object-observables*, *hilbert-hotel*. Conference speaker at events like Codemotion, where he talked about reactive programming with Node.js.

He even wrote an article titled *"Claude agents are smart, but you better check them"* -- which is ironic, given that Claude built the very site you're reading this on.

Of the four, he's the only one who could actually build a robot sommelier. And he's probably already working on it.
