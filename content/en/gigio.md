# Luigi "Gigio" Zingales

## The Wolf of Chicago

Economics degree from Bocconi with honours, PhD from MIT under the supervision of a future Nobel laureate (Oliver Hart). Today he is the *Robert C. McCormack Distinguished Service Professor of Entrepreneurship and Finance* at Chicago Booth School of Business -- a title so long it doesn't fit on a business card.

Director of the Stigler Center for the Study of the Economy and the State. President of the American Finance Association in 2014. Listed among Foreign Policy's "Top 100 Global Thinkers." Among the "Top Italian Scientists" in business and economics.

He co-authored *"Saving Capitalism from the Capitalists"* with Raghuram Rajan -- who later became Governor of the Reserve Bank of India -- and *"A Capitalism for the People,"* where he recounts how growing up in Padua taught him everything about crony capitalism.

He hosts the podcast *"Capitalisn't"* -- a pun that works better in English than after three glasses of Prosecco.

He left the Veneto to conquer America, but every year he comes back for the Prosecco. In Chicago he teaches financial markets; in Bigolino he teaches how to hold a glass.
