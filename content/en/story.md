# From Liceo Tito Livio to Prosecco: A Story of Friendship

It all began in the '70s, at the desks of **Liceo Classico Tito Livio** in Padua. Four boys born in '63 met, and from that moment on, they never let go. Philosophy, economics, politics, technology: each one took his own path, but all paths lead back here, among the Prosecco hills.

For over fifty years, they've shared endless debates, memorable bottles, and the conviction that friendship is the most serious thing there is -- even though they never stop making fun of each other.

## The Parties

- **2003 - 40 years old**: *The beginning of a tradition.* Someone said "let's have dinner for our fortieth" and no one imagined it would become an institution.
- **2013 - 50 years old**: *Half a century, same spirit.* More grey hair, same laughter.
- **2023 - 60 years old**: *59+1, azzomene!* The t-shirts prove it: age is just a number (to be rounded down).
- **2026 - 63 years old**: *63-63: the perfect number.* Why wait for 70? Prosecco doesn't wait, and neither do we.
