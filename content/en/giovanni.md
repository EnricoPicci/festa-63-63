# Giovanni Della Frattina

## The Philosopher with the Right-Wing Pen

Graduated with honours in Theoretical Philosophy from the University of Padua, then specialized in Social Communications at the Catholic University of Milan. Head of the Milan newsroom at *Il Giornale* -- the newspaper founded by Montanelli and later passed to the Berlusconi family, which tells you everything about his political leanings. He also writes for *Destra.it* -- not exactly the name of a centrist website.

Winner of the Guido Vergani Prize 2017 for Milan journalism. Member of the Board of the Arnoldo and Alberto Mondadori Foundation.

He's had more girlfriends than editorials (and he's written quite a few), two wonderful daughters, and is now finally settled with a lawyer who probably wins every argument at home.

Favourite wine? Whatever Stefano is drinking -- at least they can agree on something.
