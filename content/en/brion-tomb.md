# The Brion Tomb

## A masterpiece half an hour from the Prosecco

If you're in the area for the party and have a spare morning (or need to walk off a hangover with some contemplative strolling), **half an hour from Valdobbiadene** lies one of Italy's most extraordinary places. This is not hyperbole: the Brion Tomb is considered the supreme work of twentieth-century Italian architecture.

## The Brions and Brionvega

The **Brion** family founded **Brionvega**, the company that turned radios and televisions into design objects. If you've ever seen those 1960s TV sets that look like spaceships -- the legendary *Algol* or the *Black ST/201* -- you know what we're talking about. Giuseppe Brion, the founder, commissioned this funerary complex from Carlo Scarpa in 1969. He died before seeing it completed, in 1968. His wife Onorina carried the project forward.

## Carlo Scarpa: the genius without a degree

This is where the story gets incredible. **Carlo Scarpa** (Venice, 1906 - Sendai, 1978) is universally regarded as one of the greatest architects of the twentieth century. There's just one small detail: **he wasn't an architect**. Not in the legal sense, at least.

Scarpa graduated from the Academy of Fine Arts in Venice, not from a faculty of architecture. In **1956**, the Architects' Association of Venice reported him for **"abusivismo professionale"** -- the illegal practice of architecture. The trial became a national cause celebre. The man who was redesigning the Venice Biennale, who had reinvented the Castelvecchio Museum in Verona, who was admired worldwide... could not legally sign his own projects.

> *A genius deemed illegal by bureaucracy. In Italy, some things never change.*

Scarpa would spend his entire career signing projects as "professor" and collaborating with registered architects. The Brion Tomb is his artistic testament.

## Japan in the heart of the Veneto

Visitors to the Brion Tomb are struck by something unexpected: **it feels like Japan**. This is no accident. Scarpa had a deep obsession with Japanese aesthetics:

- The **meditation pavilion**, floating on water like a Zen temple
- The **gardens** with their dry-garden (*karesansui*) sensibility
- The **chapel**, intimate and enclosed like a tea room
- The use of **exposed concrete** (*beton brut*) treated with an almost textile delicacy
- The **interlocking circles** of the arcosolium, symbol of the eternal union between the Brion spouses

And here comes fate's cruellest irony. In **1978**, Scarpa finally realised his dream of travelling to Japan. In **Sendai**, he fell down the concrete stairs of his hotel and died of his injuries. The master of concrete and stairs, undone by both.

> *By his own wish, he is buried right here, in the Brion Tomb, standing upright, wrapped in a suit he designed himself -- like a Venetian samurai.*

## What to see

- **The arcosolium**: the arch sheltering the Brion sarcophagi, with two circles interlocking -- pure geometry becoming poetry
- **The chapel**: a gathered space where light enters like a thought
- **The meditation pool**: the pavilion on water, where the sky reflects and time stands still
- **The lawn**: the garden connecting everything, where every step reveals a new detail
- **Scarpa's tomb**: in the north-east corner, discreet, like its author
