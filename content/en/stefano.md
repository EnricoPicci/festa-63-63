# Stefano Visentin

## The Subversive Professor

Graduated with honours in Philosophy from the University of Padua -- thesis on Spinoza, naturally -- then earned a PhD in History of Political Thought from the University of Turin. Today he is Associate Professor at the University of Urbino Carlo Bo.

World expert on Spinoza: he wrote *"La liberta necessaria"* (The Necessary Freedom) on Spinozan democracy -- the kind of book you keep on your nightstand if you're Stefano, and use as a doorstop if you're Giovanni. He also wrote *"La guardia della liberta"* (The Guard of Liberty) on conquest, republic, and people between Italy and Latin America, because one revolution wasn't enough for him.

He teaches History of Political Doctrines and Political Thought of Globalisation. His research interests include Marxism, postcolonial studies, Gramsci, and the crisis of democracy -- basically everything that gives Giovanni a rash.

He has collaborated with universities from Oxford to Cordoba (Argentina). When he's not busy explaining Spinoza to his students, he's busy explaining to Giovanni why he's wrong about everything.
